# Introduction
I'm currently working on creating an Android device tree for the Motorola Moto G50, which is essentially the build configuration for Android that lets you compile your own build of [AOSP](https://www.source.android.com)
that you can successfully flash and run on your device. Even though Qualcomm and Motorola have done a lot of the work porting Android to the SOC & enabling device-specific features, you
kind of have to go backwards from the finished ROM and say "how can I describe the hardware and software setup to AOSP?" so that it can create a build that contains the same components
as your stock ROM. This process requires reading *a lot* of logs to figure out why your build isn't working and your device won't boot.

Typically, logs can be collected from an Android device using the Android Debug Bridge's `logcat` command to access the system's log buffers, but this isn't always accessible during
device bringup. What if your USB connection isn't working? What if Android hasn't booted to the point where the logging daemon `logd` has even started yet? Luckily, in most cases
the `pstore` driver is configured in the stock kernel to save kernel console & ring buffer contents to memory that won't be lost during a warm reboot, so kernel logs can often be
found that way as well. But what that wasn't configured and we didn't have kernel source code, or what if we just want to see logs before the Linux kernel has even been loaded? That's
where UART comes in.

# What is UART?
UART is a simple hardware interface to implement serial communication protocols to transmit and recieve data, only using two signals, TX and RX. 
It's often found on embedded devices like cameras or routers, and they're often used for development, debugging, and even hardware hacking where you might just be able to access a root shell! 
Now, I'm definitely not expecting to see a root shell, and in fact I'd be very surprised if it even allows recieving of commands, given the strong security of modern Android devices, 
but I think it will be interesting nonetheless.

# Choosing a phone for UART access
UART interfaces can come in many different forms - some devices repurpose the headphone jack (R.I.P Google Nexus), others use pins in the USB port (modern Pixels) or the SD card slot,
and some simply expose them as test points on the PCB (foreshadowing). I didn't want to take apart my main phone for this, especially since I didn't know if the UART pins were even going to be accessible,
so I decided to buy a phone just for this purpose. I wanted a phone from a development-friendly manufacturer, and didn't want to spend too much. That was when I came across Sony's
[Open Devices](https://developer.sony.com/open-source/aosp-on-xperia-open-devices) program. They support bootloader unlocking, publish kernel source code (it's GPL so it's kind of
ridiculous that I have to list this as a pro), and even have AOSP devices trees up on their GitHub to compile stock Android for your device. This commitment to open-source
by Sony is commendable. And, crucially, they even have a guide on [accessing UART ports](https://developer.sony.com/open-source/aosp-on-xperia-open-devices/guides/access-uart-ports/)!

Unfortunately, it looks like Sony phones aren't really sold in Canada, and as I was looking for something older & cheaper, there weren't very many options. I eventually found the Xperia XA2
on Ebay for $90 CAD - it was released in 2018 with Android 8.0 and only runs Linux 4.4, but it's good enough for my purposes here.

# Teardown
Let's check out Sony's guide and see where the UART pins are. Did we get lucky with a phone that has them on the SD card? Unfortunately not - we only get this image, which isn't very descriptive,
and no shot of the board. Time for a teardown!

{{ resize_image(path="XA2-UART-illustration_23_03_2023.png", height = 400, width=100, op="fit_height", caption="The UART location") }}

The back plastic cover comes off fairly easily with a heatgun, revealing the inside of the phone. Make sure not to pull to hard as the fingerprint sensor ribbon cable is still connected.
{{ resize_image(path="xa2_back_cover_straight.jpg", height = 400, width=100, op="fit_height", caption="The back cover partially removed") }}

Next, there's just 3 screws to remove the plastic cover over the PCB:
{{ resize_image(path="xa2_back_no_cover.jpg", height = 400, width=100, op="fit_height", caption="The back cover partially removed") }}

Do you see the UART pins? Me neither. They're right here, labelled TX and RX, on the left side:
{{ resize_image(path="./xa2_uart_closeup.jpg", height = 400, width=100, op="fit_height", caption="Closeup of the UART TX and RX pins") }}

Luckily they're not as small as the 8 JTAG pins are right above them.

# Soldering
The first attempt at soldering some cut up breadboard jumper wires failed as it was hard to get the wires to actually stick to the pads. After buying some 26-AWG solid core wire
(and using some hot glue) the second attempt went much better:

{{ resize_image(path="./xa2_solder_closeup.jpg", height = 400, width=100, op="fit_height", caption="Closeup of the UART TX and RX pins") }}

# Reading the data
Now, all we have to do is make use of the electricity flowing down these wires. Sony recommends soldering a connector to the board and using a USB-to-UART adapter, but I didn't have one
and didn't want to wait for one to arrive. But I do have an ESP32 with some GPIO pins. Can I use those and (one of the 3) onboard UART controllers to read the information? Turns out, yes!
ESP-IDF's UART API is simple to use, and we only need a few lines of code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <inttypes.h>
#include "sdkconfig.h"
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/task.h"
#include "esp_chip_info.h"
#include "esp_flash.h"
#include "esp_system.h"
#include "driver/uart.h"

#define TX_PIN 4
#define RX_PIN 5 
#define BUF_SIZE 4096

const uart_port_t uart_num = UART_NUM_1;
static QueueHandle_t uart1_queue;

static void uart_read_task(void *arg) {
    uint8_t *data = (uint8_t *) malloc(BUF_SIZE);
    while (1) {
      int length = 0;
      ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_get_buffered_data_len(uart_num, (size_t*)&length));
      length = uart_read_bytes(uart_num, data, length, 0);
      if (length != 0) {
        data[length] = '\0';
        printf("%s", (char*)data);
      }
      vTaskDelay(10 / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
    }
}

void app_main(void)
{
    uart_config_t uart_config = {
        .baud_rate = 115200,
        .data_bits = UART_DATA_8_BITS,
        .parity = UART_PARITY_DISABLE,
        .stop_bits = UART_STOP_BITS_1,
        .flow_ctrl = UART_HW_FLOWCTRL_DISABLE,
    };
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_param_config(uart_num, &uart_config));

    // Set UART pins(TX: IO4, RX: IO5, RTS: disabled, CTS: disabled)
    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_set_pin(uart_num, TX_PIN, RX_PIN, UART_PIN_NO_CHANGE, UART_PIN_NO_CHANGE));

    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_driver_install(uart_num, BUF_SIZE, BUF_SIZE, 10, &uart1_queue, 0));

    xTaskCreate(uart_read_task, "uart_read_task", 2048, NULL, 10, NULL);
}
```

This code sets up the UART controller with the correct baud rate and transmission settings, specifies which GPIO pins to use, and starts reading into a buffer in a loop.
Here's the simple hardware setup - just an ESP32, a breadboard, and two wires.
{{ resize_image(path="whole_setup.jpg", height = 400, width=100, op="fit_height", caption="The simple setup") }}

# Logs
After flashing the code and rebooting the device, we do see some output. It works! Sort of.

There's some missing lines and some corrupted characters too. After some messing around with the buffer size & read delay (which initially improved the output somewhat), I connected the RX
pin (since the code only reads data I didn't have it connected). For some reason that did it, and we now get [super clean UART output](https://gist.github.com/robbins/d89f113e79cde1ac8e11221c7f3840d9)

# Conclusion
With some soldering and a small amount of code, I was able to capture logs from every different level of Android's boot process (more of which can be read about [here](https://lineageos.org/engineering/Qualcomm-Firmware/)),
including the PBL which is stored on the SoC itself. This can be an invaluable step when debugging issues in the early stages of device bringup. If you've explored a similar thing, I'd
love to hear about your successes (or headaches) with UART or Android bringup.
